# Creating Networks: Kayla Corbin

  A network is a tool that can be used to organize data. A network consists of nodes and edges, essentially mapping out relationships between different points of data. In this project, I used data from Supreme Court cases, specifically cases on sexual discrimination. One interesting thing about Networks is that you can use them to view the same data in different ways. After entering the data set, I was able to change the the color of the nodes to present different information. I ended up creating five different networks. Some of the networks generated a lot of questions and led me to do research to add more context. For example, the first data set was plotted based on the year. A lot of the main cases that were closer together were from the mid 70s to the early 90s, at first I was curious as to why, but then after doing a bit of research, this doesn’t come as a surprise. During the mid to late 70s to early 90s, women were revolutionizing the workplace, and actually beginning to report sexual assault and really rally for equal pay. This spike in advocacy for women in the workplace is definitely reflected by the Supreme Court cases on sexual discrimination.The network that was plotted using votes did create some questions though, and because of the limitations of networks, I am unable to answer it. It seems as if on many cases there was very little to no judges in favor of the party claiming discrimination. Although it's possible to just go look up the case and see the judges presiding over the court, the downfall to the networks I created is that useful information like who was on the court at the time is not readily available. Even though this is important context, it would have to be looked up outside of just viewing the network. Another limitation of Networks is that if you include too much data your network can become unreadable and not give much concise useful data. That’s the reason I chose two sets of cases to compare instead of three. When I tried three I was given a much bigger network but it didn’t allow me to draw tight conclusions as much as using two sets of sexual discrimination cases did. In networking, picking and choosing which data you use can lead to unintended consequences, as explained by Scott B. Weingart in Demystifying Networks, Parts I & II, he says, “Unfortunately, given that humanistic data are often uncertain and biased to begin with, every arbitrary act of data-cutting has the potential to add further uncertainty and bias to a point where the network no longer provides meaningful results. The ability to cut away just enough data to make the network manageable, but not enough to lose information, is as much an art as it is a science.” Keeping in this in mind, I chose my data carefully and made sure I was cautious deciding what data should stay. Networks present multiple limitations, but if you keep those limitations in mind, they are a great source of information. Overall, there is much that can be shown and learned from the visuals and relationships created in a network.
