 Topic Modeling is a tool that discovers recurring topics within a collection of data. Essentially, you can use Topic Modeling to group together words that are commonly found together within a compilation of data.One way to think about how the process of topic modeling works is to imagine working through an article with a set of highlighters. As you read through the article, you use a different color for the key words of themes within the paper as you come across them.(Brett, Topic Modeling and Digital Humanities, 2012).In order to accomplish this, I used R, a computer program that assisted in creating topic models.In terms of how topic modeling relates to digital humanities, Blei said is best,  “A humanist imagines the kind of hidden structure that she wants to discover and embeds it in a model that generates her archive. The form of the structure is influenced by her theories and knowledge — time and geography, linguistic theory, literary theory, gender, author, politics, culture, history.” (Blei, Topic Modeling and Digital Humanities, 2012).  I was able to do what Blei describes in terms of going in with an initial hypothesis, and after topic modeling I saw things in a new way.  
  For this project, I used Journal Articles from *American Music* published by the University of Illinois. *American Music* publishes articles on musicians, composers, entertainers and institutions related to American history and culture. The data set I used were all articles from *American Music* that have been published between 1983 and 2018. Originally my question was, How much of the journal could be relevant to non musicians. However, what I discovered through topic modeling is that, the journal is more about the people and events that contribute to musical culture than it is about instruments or music itself. This discovery is the reason I selected 18 topics, (25 are pictured but I wouldn’t use seven of them). I chose 18 topics because I realized the journal had a lot to do with what influences artists that helped shape our culture. For example, there is a topic on folk, and the words in that topic bubble show how the area in which a person lived in America helped shaped certain musical genres. The topics I didn’t use were mostly abbreviations or “stop words” such as, “the”, “and” and “it”.  Topic Modeling definitely presents some challenges. Earlier, I quoted a statement from Blei where he said that topic modeling can help someone studying the humanities discover new things about their topic. However, limitations can actually make Topic Modeling not as useful. For example, you can have a hypothesis in mind, but when you get your data, it can disprove what you once believed. In my specific case I ran into issues with stop words, also because it's such a large corpus of data, some topics might not be relevant to your hypothesis. 
	Overall, Topic Modeling can be a useful tool for people studying the humanities. As long as a person recognizes the limitations of topic modeling then there are many questions that topic modeling can help answer.
